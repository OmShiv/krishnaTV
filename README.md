# krishnaTV
I am trying to convert http://www.krishna.tv website into a more intuitive webapp. Along the way I am trying to create a generic media player webapp. 
For this project MEAN (Mongo/Express/AngularJs/NodeJS) technology stack has been used

## Quick start
1. Clone or download zip this repository
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/amandogra/krishnaTV.git
  ```

2. Run mongo DB locally. (Install mongodb if neccessary from http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)
  ```
  mongod
  ```

3. Start the local server by using:
  ```
  grunt serve
  ```

4. Open http://localhost:9000/dashboard in your choice of browser.
